# Tokenized Commercial Electrical System Maintenance

## Overview

The Tokenized Commercial Electrical System Maintenance platform is a blockchain-based solution designed to revolutionize how commercial buildings manage their electrical infrastructure. By leveraging smart contracts and tokenization, the system creates a transparent, efficient, and accountable framework for electrical system maintenance, ensuring both operational reliability and regulatory compliance.

## Core Components

The platform consists of four interconnected smart contracts that work together to provide comprehensive electrical system management:

1. **Building Registration Contract**: Establishes digital identities for commercial structures with detailed metadata including location, size, construction date, occupancy type, and ownership information.

2. **System Inventory Contract**: Creates a complete digital catalog of a building's electrical infrastructure components, including panels, transformers, generators, distribution systems, and safety equipment with their specifications and lifecycle data.

3. **Maintenance Scheduling Contract**: Manages the planning, assignment, verification, and documentation of regular inspections, testing procedures, and repair activities through automated workflows.

4. **Compliance Tracking Contract**: Ensures adherence to relevant electrical codes and standards by validating maintenance activities against regulatory requirements and generating verifiable compliance records.

## Key Benefits

- **Enhanced Safety**: Systematic tracking of critical electrical components and their maintenance reduces safety incidents
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Automated verification of code adherence with immutable audit trails for inspectors
- **Operational Reliability**: Scheduled preventative maintenance minimizes unexpected failures and downtime
- **Tokenized Incentives**: Reward system for timely maintenance completion and compliance achievements
- **Transparent History**: Complete maintenance records accessible to stakeholders throughout a building's lifecycle
- **Risk Reduction**: Documented maintenance history may lead to reduced insurance premiums
- **Asset Value Protection**: Well-maintained electrical systems preserve building value and reduce capital expenditures
- **Service Provider Accountability**: Verifiable proof of completed work and quality assurance

### Tokenization Model

The platform implements a dual-token system:

1. **Building Asset Tokens (BATs)**: Non-fungible tokens representing registered buildings and their electrical systems, containing metadata about the structure and its components.

2. **Maintenance Compliance Tokens (MCTs)**: Fungible tokens issued upon successful completion of required maintenance activities and achievement of compliance milestones.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet with ETH for gas fees
- Node.js (v16.0+)
- Hardhat or Truffle development environment
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/electrical-maintenance.git
cd electrical-maintenance
```

2. Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. Configure environment
```
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and private keys
```

4. Compile contracts
```
npx hardhat compile
```

5. Deploy to test network
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
```

## Usage Guide

### For Building Owners/Managers

1. Register building with detailed structural information
2. Create comprehensive inventory of electrical components
3. Establish maintenance schedules based on component requirements and code specifications
4. Receive notifications for upcoming maintenance needs
5. Verify completed maintenance work
6. Generate compliance reports for regulatory submissions
7. Earn and utilize Maintenance Compliance Tokens

### For Electrical Service Providers

1. Browse available maintenance tasks
2. Submit qualifications for specific job types
3. Document inspection findings and work performed
4. Submit verification of completed maintenance
5. Build verifiable reputation through on-chain work history
6. Receive token rewards for quality work and compliance contributions

### For Regulators/Inspectors

1. Access transparent maintenance records
2. Verify compliance with electrical codes
3. Review historical data on building electrical systems
4. Validate certifications and testing results

## Development Roadmap

- **Phase 1** (Completed): Core smart contract development and testing
- **Phase 2** (Current): Web application interface and service provider marketplace
- **Phase 3** (Q4 2025): Mobile application for field technicians with offline capabilities
- **Phase 4** (Q1 2026): IoT integration for automated monitoring and reporting
- **Phase 5** (Q2 2026): AI-powered predictive maintenance recommendations
- **Phase 6** (Q3 2026): Cross-chain implementation for broader ecosystem compatibility

## Security Considerations

- Role-based access control for all contract functions
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Circuit breakers for emergency situations
- Comprehensive audit trail for all modifications
- Regular third-party security audits
